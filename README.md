# Analysis and Prediction of Sports Events using Machine Learning Algorithms

The aim of this project is to develop machine learning algorithms, in order to predict the outcome of a football match. All the data that are used, are located 
at the following website:

,in the form of an SQLite database. In fact,the useful information for implementing the learning mechanisms is stored in the Match and Team_Attributes tables.

- Linear Neural Network
- Multilayer Neural Network
- Fuzzy C-Means Clustering
